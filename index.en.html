<p>Sporz is a social deduction secret identify game similar to Werewolf/Mafia/Loup-garou. However the strategic aspect is more important and players have more things to do. When I present the game, I often tell these advantages compared to Werewolf/Mafia/Loup-garou :
<ul>
    <li>Nobody is bored at night because everyone has a <strong>useful</strong> role.
    <li>Every role is useful but one information by itself is not very useful, we <strong>need</strong> informations of other players combined with our information.
    <li>Because of the fact we have real information, we use real <strong>arguments</strong> during the vote, we don't hear arguments like "I heard him moving during the night" or "he seems suspicious".
    <li>There are way less death in the beginning of the game : the base action of mutants are to <strong>mutate</strong>, players switch sides!
    <li>Moreover, we can choose to vote <strong>blank</strong>, that means voting for killing nobody
    <li>Votes are <strong>privates</strong>
    <li>During the day we don't talk in public, we only talk in <strong>groups of maximum 3</strong>, it leads to gossip and rumor makings.
</ul>
<p>I did the animation of this game at the <a href="https://brusselsgamesfestival.be">Brussels Game Festival</a> in 2017 and people had a lot of fun !

<p>On this site, I propose <a href="jeu.html">an app</a> that allows to play without GM (Game Master). Please put a phone or a mouse in the middle of the table so that everyone can have access to it, and activate the sound !
